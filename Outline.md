Unit I

Warm Up A: 
	Review Linux Command Lines
		e.g.
		echo > output_file.txt
		cd 
		ls
		
	
Arduino
1. Lab1: Basic Arduino IDE Setup
2. Lab2: Reading Data From Arduino
3. Lab3: Send Data to Arduino
4. Lab4: Setting Up Sensors (maybe one or two)
5. Lab5: Setting Up Actuators 
6. Lab6: How to Display Data Stream in Terminal (Python)

Unit II

Warm Up B: Arduino Setup

Python:
7. Lab7: Basic Python Libraries (print, string, time)
8. Lab8: Creating You Own Data Stream
9. Lab9: Save Raw Data Stream To a Text File
10. Lab10: Parse Text File and save in your 'database' folder
11. Lab11:  Save Arduino Data Stream to a Table in your Database Folder (Arduino)
Discussion: Databases 
(not going to go into any specifics just how to save data into a txt file or csv table)

Unit III
Warm Up C: Python Basic Libraries

PiCamera (Using Python):

Unit IV
OpenCV (Using Python *** Maybe ***):

Unit V
Databases (Using Python, SQL *** Maybe ***):

Unit VI
Machine Learning Programs( Using Python *** Maybe ***):

Unit VII
Git Version Control
	Write a story in md

Unit VIII
Final Projects (Make and Test an experiment using what we've learned in this class)

Unit IX
Extra Credit: Getting an Interesting Piece of Pi or Arduino code to work and make a Writeup of it???

(Based on what Jordan Finds Interesting,

.e.g. stream pi camera to web browser)
