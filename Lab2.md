Lab2:
Maybe start with ardunio hello world instead?

Create a counter to record number of times arduino blinks.

Create a variable the records the number of blinks

Initialize the serial port with Serial.begin(9300) in the Setup Function.

Add Serial.println(Blink_Counter) to the loop() function.

Open Python IDLE For Commant line entry of 

Serial2.py

Do the same thing but using the terminal. commands and script. 


Create Pythonscript Serial2.py



Run And Counter should print in terminal. 

Discussion: 
  What is serial, and why does the program break when you use Serial.print('a') instead?

What haooens when you turn off the python program, then turn it back on again?
Does the program ever loose count?
Where are the numbers being stored while the program is off?
